    			<h1 class="creative_text">About Us</h1>
    			<p style="color: #050000; text-align: justify;">We wish to introduce ourselves as DAY ATM a business entity which has ventured into the field of Payment Services and forayed into deployment of White label ATM machines (WLAs) and Android based mPOS - mini ATM cum card swipe machines distribution as well.
We have chosen to explore the highly innovative and value driven business of White Label ATM Machine deployment and distribution of mPOS mini ATM Swipe Machines in our own brand name ‘NPays’, as we could see the surge in banking cum financial transactions through these modes in the years to come. We wish to lead the market and are destined to be the top payment services solutions provider. We are the pioneers and the first in India to introduce mini ATM based kiosks which has the functions of Cash withdrawal and Cash deposits under our brand name ‘Day ATM’.
We are headquartered at Chennai and are working towards creating a micro level networked infrastructure for the deployment of WLAs, Day ATM Kiosks and mPOS devices to every nook and corner, irrespective of whether it is Urban part or a Rural part of India. We are striving hard with our workforce to establish a brand name in this field and carve a niche for ourselves.  
Our goal is to support customers and provide fillip with reference to accessible Payment Services beyond Tier I and Tier II cities by deployment of these machines at every possible level. These ‘under-served areas’ viz., rural areas and villages where banking and financial services are ‘out of reach’ have a huge potential for monetary transactions through digital payment. We also wish to utilise our franchise model to market banking products including CASA, loans and other financial products of banks and financial institutions.
Even as we are taking our baby steps as a beginner in this sector, we have well devised plans to penetrate this highly potential market and are poised to grow leaps and bounds and evolve as a well-known brand. Our vision is to make use of the untapped potential and is aimed at providing one stop solutions for the public at large. We have rightly captioned our motive as ‘Digital Unite’ since we have planned the following segments under different verticals:
• Cash deposit and withdrawals
• AEPS, UPI and QR code based payments
• All types of card swipe facility
• Utility bill payments, travel & movie ticket bookings
• Banking products viz., CASA opening, Loans
• Facilitator services with reference to banks’ and private sector financiers’ asset products
• Collections of loans and financial products both through the machines and as nodal points
We are riding on the RBI’s initiative of digital payment drive and hope to be an umbrella providing hassle free financial bouquet and grow along with the our franchisee, banker, financier and customer which will help us in our motto – together we grow.</p>
